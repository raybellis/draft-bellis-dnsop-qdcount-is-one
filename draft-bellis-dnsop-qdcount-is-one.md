--- abstract

This document clarifies the allowable values of the QDCOUNT parameter
in DNS messages with OPCODE = 0 (QUERY) and specifies the required
behaviour when values that are not allowed are encountered.

# Introduction

The DNS protocol {{!RFC1034}{{!RFC1035}} includes a parameter QDCOUNT
in the DNS message header, whose value is specified to mean the
number of questions in the Question Section of a message.

In a general sense it seems perfectly plausible for the QDCOUNT
parameter, an unsigned 16-bit value, to take a considerable range
of values. However, in the specific case of messages that encode
DNS queries and responses (messages with OPCODE = 0) there are other
limitations inherent in the protocol that constrain values of QDCOUNT
to be either 0 or 1. In particular, several parameters specified
for DNS response messages such as AA and RCODE have no defined
meaning when the message contains multiple queries, since there is
no way to signal which question those parameters relate to.

In this document we briefly survey the existing written DNS
specification; we provide a description of the semantic and practical
requirements for DNS queries that naturally constrain the allowable
values of QDCOUNT; and we update the DNS base specification to
clarify the allowable values of the QDCODE parameter in the specific
case of DNS messages with OPCODE = 0 (QUERY).

# Terminology used in this document

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear
in all capitals, as shown here.

# QDCOUNT is (usually) One

The following brief survey provides some commentary on the use of
QDCOUNT in the written DNS specification.

## OPCODE = 0 (QUERY) and 1 (IQUERY)

{{!RFC1035}} significantly predates the use of normative requirements
keywords, and parts of it are consequently somewhat open to
interpretation.

Section 4.1.2 ("Question section format") has this to say about
QDCOUNT:

> The section contains QDCOUNT (usually 1) entries

The only documented exceptions within {{!RFC1035}} relate to the
IQuery Opcode, where the request has "an empty question section"
(QDCOUNT == 0), and "zero, one, or multiple domain names for the
specified resource as QNAMEs in the question section". The IQuery
OpCode was made obsolete in {{!RFC3425}}.

In the absence of clearly expressed normative requirements, we rely
on other text in {{!RFC1035}} that makes use of the definite article
or other text that implies a singuar question and, by implication,
QDCOUNT = 1.

For example, Section 4.1:

> the question for the name server

and:

> The question section contains fields that describe a question to a
> name server

and in Section 4.1.1. ("Header section format"):

> AA Authoritative Answer - this bit is valid in responses,
>    and specifies that the responding name server is an
>    authority for the domain name in question section.

DNS Cookies {{?RFC7873}} in Section 5.4 allow a client to receive
a valid Server Cookie without sending a specific question by sending
a Query packet (OpCode 0) with QDCOUNT == 0, with the resulting
response also containing no question.

## OPCODE = 4 (NOTIFY)

DNS Notify {{?RFC1996}} also lacks a clearly defined range of values
for QDCOUNT.  Section 3.7 says:

> A NOTIFY request has QDCOUNT > 0

but all other text in the RFC talks about the <QNAME, QCLASS, QTYPE>
tuple in the singular.

## OPCODE = 5 (UPDATE)

DNS Update {{?RFC2136}} renames the QDCOUNT field to ZOCOUNT, but
the value is constrained to be one by Section 2.3 ("Zone Section"):

> All records to be updated must be in the same zone, and therefore the
> Zone Section is allowed to contain exactly one record.

## OPCODE = 6 (DNS Stateful Operations, DSO)

DNS Stateful Operations {{?RFC8490}} (DSO - OpCode 6) attempts to
preserve compatibility with the standard DNS 12 octet header, and
does so by requiring that all four of the section count values be
set to zero.

## Conclusion

There is no description in {{!RFC1035}} that describes how other
parameters in the DNS message such as AA, RCODE should be interpreted
in the case where a message includes more than one question. An
originator of a query with QDCOUNT > 1 can have no expectations of
how it will be processed, and the receiver of a response with QDCOUNT
> 1 has no guidance for how it should be interpreted.

The allowable values of QDCOUNT seem to be clearly specified for
OPCODE = 4 (NOTIFY), OPCODE = 5 (UPDATE) and OPCODE = 6 (DNS Stateful
Operations, DSO). OPCODE = 1 (IQUERY) is obsolete and OPCODE = 2
(STATUS) is not specified. OPCODE = 3 is reserved.

The allowable values of QDCOUNT are specified in {{?RFC1035}} without
the clarity of normative language, and this looseness of language
results in some ambiguity.

# Updates to RFC 1035

A DNS message with OPCODE = 0 (QUERY) MUST NOT include a QDCOUNT
parameter whose value is greater than 1. It follows that the Question
Section of a DNS message with OPCODE = 0 MUST NOT contain more than
one question.

A DNS message with OPCODE = 0 (QUERY) and QDCOUNT > 1 MUST be treated
as an incorrectly-formatted message. If a response is generated for
a query that includes more than one question, the value of the RCODE
parameter in the response message MUST be set to 1 (FORMERR).

Firewalls that process DNS messages in order to eliminate unwanted
traffic MAY treat messages with OPCODE = 0 and QDCOUNT > 1 as
unwanted traffic.

# Security Considerations

This document clarifies the DNS specification and aims to improve
interoperability between different DNS implementations. In general,
the elimination of ambiguity seems well-aligned with security
hygiene.

# IANA Considerations

This document has no IANA actions.
